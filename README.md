Analytical Model for analyzing the mechanical properties of tubular braided composites

Braided Composites can be manufactured in several different braiding patterns: Diamond (1/1), Regular (2/2) and Hercules (3/3).  Examples of the different patterns are shown below

Current work on braided composites typically focuses on one specific pattern.  The goal of this model is to be able to predict the mechanical properties of all the available braiding patterns.
Another limitation of current studies that examine braided composites is that most researchers do not take into consideration the geometry and the physical process of manufacturing composite braids.
Both braid geometry and the manufacturing process has an effect on the mechanical properties of tubular braided composites.
